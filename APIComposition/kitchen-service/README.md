# Introduction

Kitchen Service enables a restaurant to manage their orders.
The two main aggregates in this service are the Restaurant and Ticket aggregates.
The Restaurant aggregate knows the restaurantâ€™s menu and opening hours and can validate orders.
A Ticket represents an order that a restaurant must prepare for pickup by a courier.
